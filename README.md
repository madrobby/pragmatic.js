# Pragmatic.js code style guidelines

## TL;DR

* `function name() { }` for named functions
* `function(){ }` for anonymous functions
* Use short and concise expressions
* Prefer functional programming over for or while loops
* No curly braces for single-line control flow statements such as `if` & friends
* Don't write [semicolons that are optional][optional]
* Put a single semicolon _before_ statements that start with `(` or `[`
  (see above article as for why it's needed)
* Use long, descriptive variable and method names
* Use blank lines to separate "paragraphs" of code for readability
* Use comments to describe non-obvious code behavior
* Don't write comments that do not add to code understanding
* Optimize for performance only if there's a measureable problem
* Use ternary when it is simple enough as to not make code difficult to understand

## Pragmatic JavaScript

The word pragmatic means _"Practical, concerned with making decisions 
and actions that are useful in practice, not just theory."[1]_ Writing pragmatic
JavaScript is all about optimizing the process of writing JavaScript for you 
as a programmer, using all the facilities the language provides. 

Writing less code is good; emphasized by the no optional semicolons rule, by 
no curly braces where not necessary and by using functional programming constructs
whereever possible.

At the same time, when you come back to your code later, you want to understand it—
thus long, descriptive variable and method names, and comments where necessary.

JavaScript is a modern, flexible and malleable scripting language, and it deserves
to be treated as such. Pragmatic.js is also about discovering and learning the language
strengths as well as its quirks so you can make full use of it.

### Examples

Here are some examples from [Zepto.js][zepto].

```javascript
// typical helper function
function eachEvent(events, fn, iterator){
  if ($.isObject(events)) $.each(events, iterator)
  else events.split(/\s/).forEach(function(type){ iterator(type, fn) })
}

// shortcut methods for `.bind(event, fn)` for each event type
;('focusin focusout load resize scroll unload click dblclick '+
'mousedown mouseup mousemove mouseover mouseout '+
'change select keydown keypress keyup error').split(' ').forEach(function(event) {
  $.fn[event] = function(callback){ return this.bind(event, callback) }
})

// from Zepto core, $.fn.siblings implementation
function filtered(nodes, selector) {
  return selector === undefined ? $(nodes) : $(nodes).filter(selector)
}

$.fn.siblings = function(selector){
  return filtered(this.map(function(i, el){
    return slice.call(el.parentNode.children).filter(function(child){ return child!==el })
  }), selector)
}
```

### Contribute

I welcome contributions—this guide is very basic at the moment and should probably have some more
guidelines for specific situations and how to get started. You know where the fork & pull request
buttons are.
